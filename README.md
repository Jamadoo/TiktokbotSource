## üî• Overview

This is an **advanced Telegram bot** powered by **ChatGPT** and paired with multiple AI models (like **ElevenLabs**, **Suno**, and **reverse-engineered APIs**) to generate **three unique types of TikTok videos**.

---

## üé• Video Types

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Reddit to Video

* Scrapes the **top 50 posts** from a chosen subreddit (defaults to `r/`) via the Reddit API.
* Extracts **titles** and **body text** from posts.
* Uses **ChatGPT** (with a 10,000-char prompt) to pick the post most likely to **perform best** in a short video format.
* Fetches **top 100 comments** (plus replies up to 3 levels deep) and stores them in an array of objects.
* Applies hardcoded methods to **filter and format comments**.
* Another 10,000-char ChatGPT prompt is used to refine, merge, and clean comments into a **story-driven, safe-for-work script**.
* Generates a **custom Reddit-like UI** (HTML-based), with **per-sentence screenshots** that reveal each line as it's spoken.
* Uses **ElevenLabs** for text-to-speech (sentence by sentence).
* Picks a **random background video & song** (ChatGPT matches them to the topic).
* Builds the final video using a **complex FFMPEG pipeline**.
* ChatGPT also creates **captions & hashtags**.
* **Auto-upload attempts to TikTok** (via contribution to [TikTokUploader Bot](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/tiktok-uploader))‚Äîabandoned due to unreliability. Switched to **GoFile** for hosting, then manual upload.
* Sends final video link to Telegram.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Even plays with **raw MP3 data** at some point.
* Posted on TikTok: [UpvoteVoices](https://www.tiktok.com/@upvotevoices)

  * Example: [Watch Here](https://www.tiktok.com/@upvotevoices/video/7365241679189724459)
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è Account likely shadow-banned (TikTok flagged bot uploads).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Message Convo to Video

* ChatGPT creates a **weird/funny conversation** idea between two fictional people (5,000-char prompt).

* Splits conversation into structured objects.
* Reverse-engineers a **website API** (via Burp Suite) to generate **WhatsApp/Instagram-style chat UIs** for each message.
* Generates **voiceovers** for each line.
* ChatGPT chooses a **matching background video & music track**.
* Final video rendered using **another dynamic FFMPEG command**.
* Uploaded to **GoFile**; link sent over Telegram.
* ChatGPT writes the caption.
* Posted on TikTok: [TextMeStories](https://www.tiktok.com/@textmestories8)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: Outdated

This bot **no longer works** due to:

* AI platform updates
* Token exhaustion
* Reverse-engineered API changes
* Dependency deprecation

But, it‚Äôs designed so I could **revive it in the future** with relative ease.

---

## ü§Ø a Little Rant

* FFMPEG is surprisingly hard to master ‚Äî docs are okay-ish but no solid crash courses exist.
* Even ChatGPT struggles to write reliable FFMPEG scripts.
